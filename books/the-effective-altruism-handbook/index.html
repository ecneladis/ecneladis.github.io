<h2 id="i-what-is-effective-altruism">I. What is Effective Altruism?</h2>

<p><strong>Effective altruism</strong> is a growing community based around the
idea of aiming to do the most good that one can. It involves:</p>

<ol>
<li>Being open to all the possible ways to do good and
pursuing the path with the biggest positive impact;</li>
<li>Using evidence to figure out how to do the most good;
and</li>
<li>Choosing to make altruism a significant part of one’s life.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-the-drowning-child-and-the-expanding-circle">1. The Drowning Child and the Expanding Circle</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The ancients knew of the “paradox of hedonism”, according to which the more explicitly we pursue our desire for pleasure, the more elusive we will find its satisfaction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="3-scope-neglect">3. Scope Neglect</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Scope neglect has been shown to apply to human lives.
Carson and Mitchell (1995) report that increasing the alleged
risk associated with chlorinated drinking water from 0.004 to
2.43 annual deaths per 1,000 (a factor of 600) increased SWTP
from $3.78 to $15.23 (a factor of 4). Baron and Greene found
no effect from varying lives saved by a factor of ten. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="6-efficiency-measures-miss-the-point">6. “Efficiency” Measures Miss the Point</h3>

<p>Two fatal errors:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first is that high administrative efficiency equals high impact. It doesn’t.</li>
<li>The second is that the admin-to-program ratio is measuring efficiency. If it isn’t measuring impact, it’s axiomatic that it isn’t measuring efficiency, because the only efficiency that matters is the efficiency associated with impact. Take the frugal breast cancer charity that consistently fails to find a cure for breast cancer. The last word a woman dying of breast cancer would use to describe it would be “efficient.” Not if she factors in the value of her life</li>

<h4 id="11-high-impact-science">11. High Impact Science</h4>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Population_Bomb">The Population Bomb</a>: The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The agronomist Norman Borlaug, who developed new and more effective methods of plant breeding, used them to develop the key strain of wheat, and brought about expansion of his methods to other crops and deployment in South Asia, played a pivotal role. Some credit him with saving a billion lives, referring to the number of people fed by the increased agricultural production of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution">Green Revolution</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, tremendous impacts are possible through speeding the pace of progress, even slightly. According to the WHO, malaria killed over 781,000 people in 2009. If current trends continue, advances in vaccines, bednets, mosquito control and increased deployment efforts will likely eventually drive fatalities down to zero. But leaping ahead in this process by a single year could save 781,000 lives. A single day’s speedup would save 2,139 lives. Advancing the process by even 40 seconds would save a life. The question therefore becomes: by how many seconds can you expect to advance your field over your career?</p>

<h4 id="12-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career">12. How to Assess the Impact of a Career</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>The standard view is that to make a difference with your career, you need to work in organizations with a social mission, such as charities, hospitals and schools. But this view is overly simplistic. <strong>Many of the highest-impact people in history were politicians, entrepreneurs, and academics (think Bill Gates or Norman Borlaug).</strong> And there’s a lot of variation in the good done by different charities: some aren’t effective at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You “make a difference” whenever you contribute to solving important social problems, enabling others to flourish now and in the long-run.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-four-factors">The four factors</h5>

<ol>
<li><strong>Role Impact:</strong>
“We typically consider three types of influence: the direct impact you achieve through your work itself; the earnings that you can donate to charity or invest in training; and the potential to advocate for important causes through your work.”</li>
<li><strong>Career Capital:</strong>
“Career Capital is the extent to which a role enables you to amass valuable skills, connections and credentials to get into better positions in the long run.”</li>
<li><strong>Personal Fit:</strong>
“if you’re good at and enjoy what you’re looking to do, you’re likely to have a greater impact and build better career capital.”</li>
<li><strong>Exploration Value:</strong>
“Exploration Value is the extent to which an option will help you to learn about your options so you can make better decisions in the future in order to maximize your impact.”</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="13-your-dollar-goes-further-overseas">13. Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We understand the sentiment that “charity starts at home”, and we used to agree with it, until we learned just how much less effective US charity is than charity aimed at the poorest people in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="14-the-haste-consideration">14. The Haste Consideration</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The first lesson is that influencing people to become effective altruists is a pretty high value strategy for improving the world.
The second lesson is that you can do more good with time in the present than you can with time in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="15-preventing-human-extinction">15. Preventing Human Extinction</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The search is, however, not yet complete. The new B612 foundation has recently begun a project to track the remaining asteroids in order to “protect the future of civilization on this planet.” Finding one of these asteroids could be the key to preventing a global catastrophe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>So far, surprisingly little work has been put into systematically understanding the risks of human extinction and how best to reduce them.</strong> There have been a few books and papers on the topic of low-probability, high-stakes catastrophes, but there has been very little investigation into the most effective methods of reducing these risks: we know of no in-depth, systematic analysis of the different potential strategies. It follows that a reasonable first step toward reducing the risk of human extinction would be to investigate these issues more thoroughly, or support others in doing so.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pessimists like the nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, or the contemporary South African philosopher David Benatar accept this conclusion. But if parents have a reasonable expectation that their children will have happy and fulfilling lives, and having children would not be harmful to others, then it is not bad to have children. <strong>More generally, if our descendants have a reasonable chance of having happy and fulfilling lives, it is good for us to ensure that our descendants exist, rather than not.</strong> Therefore we think that bringing future generations into existence can be a good thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="16-speciesism">16. Speciesism</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Be assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a complete refutation of the doubts I myself have entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted to them by nature, and to find that they are on a par with ourselves&hellip;but whatever be their degree of talent it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the property or persons of others.</p>
